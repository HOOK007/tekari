## Usage

### Command Line

You can launch **Tekari** in the command line and specify data samples to be loaded as command-line arguments:

```
./tekari data_set_1 data_set_2 ...
```

This will launch **Tekari** and open the specified files, assuming they are in the correct format (see [file format](#file-format)).

### Graphical User Interface
To get started using **Tekari**, you first need to load a file, either using the [command line](#command-line), pressing the open file button (folder icon), or using Ctrl-O. Once you have a data sample loaded, you can interact with it in many ways:
- look at it from any angle (by left-dragging the mouse on the canvas)
- zoom in and out (using the mouse wheel)
- translate it (by middle-dragging the mouse)
- or also slect points (by right-dragging the mouse) 

These are just the basics features that allow you to take a closer look at your data. If you want a more detailed explanation of the features (and associated shortcuts) supported by **Tekari**, you can just click the help button (top right of the tools window) or just press 'H' to bring up the help window. Hovering over any gui element will also display an helpful tooltip.

## File-Format
The two file formats **Tekari** supports are:
- standard or spectral data samples: these are texte files containing raw BSDF measurements generated by [*pgII*](#pgII).
- bsdf files: binary files with the .bsdf extension, computed from [*pgII*](#pgII) measurements and processed following the paper *An Adaptive Parameterization for Efficient Material Acquisition and Rendering* by Jonathan Dupuy and Wenzel Jakob.

## pgII
pgII is a goniophotometer used by [RGL](https://rgl.epfl.ch/) at EPFL. It is used to analyse the intensity of light reflected by a material at a given wavelength, or accross all the visible spectrum. It does so by *scanning* a material sample, following a hemisphere path, capturing the reflected light at precise angles. These raw measurements result in list of points with the format `theta phi intensity` (theta and phi being the angles, in degrees, at which the given intensity was measured). The format also includes some metadata at the beggining of the file, and even if most of it isn't required for **Tekari** to correctly load the file, the spectral data requires the first line (as there is no file extension distinguishing standard and spectral file formats).

## Building tekari
All you need to compile **tekari** for desktop usage is a C++11 compiler. First, you'll need to clone the repo with the following command

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rgl-epfl/tekari
```

If you accidentally omitted the --recursive flag when cloning this repository you can initialize the submodules like so:

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**tekari** uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system. The following sections detail how it should be used on various operating systems.

### Linux/MacOS

On macOS and most Linux distributions [CMake](https://cmake.org/) can be obtained via a package manager (Homebrew on macOS, apt on Ubuntu/Debian, etc.). Most Linux distributions additionally require *xorg*, *gl*, and *zlib* development packages and *zenity*. On Ubuntu/Debian simply call

```
$ apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev zenity
```

Once all dependencies are installed, create a new directory to contain build artifacts, enter it, and then invoke [CMake](https://cmake.org/) with the root **tekari** folder as argument as shown in the following example:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

Afterwards, **tekari** can be built and run via

$ make tekari
$ ./tekari

### Windows

On Windows, install [CMake](https://cmake.org/), open the included GUI application, and point it to the root directory of tev. [CMake](https://cmake.org/) will then generate Visual Studio project files for compiling tev. Make sure you select at least Visual Studio 2017 or higher!

## Credits

**Tekari** has been developped at [RGL](https://rgl.epfl.ch/) by Beno√Æt Ruiz under the supervision of [Tizian Zeltner](http://tizianzeltner.com/) and [Wenzel Jakob](http://rgl.epfl.ch/people/wjakob/).
