- GLFrameBuffer: how to write to it
- look at instant meshes for framebuffers

// Debug tool:
--> gdb myApp
--> catch throw
--> run
--> bt

// Issues:
- delaunay crashes for too big inputs

// To do:
- spectral data

- select individual points
- move point along path
- predicted outgoing angle 
- moving for notepads (scroll+ALT), selection is weird
- use terminal input for files (options)

// issues:
- delete points random crashes + not threaded
- can't figure out how to draw grid info behind datasample
